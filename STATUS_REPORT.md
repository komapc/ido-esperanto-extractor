## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Place Names as Vocabulary

Some place names are being analyzed as regular vocabulary because they end in grammatical suffixes:

**Examples:**
- `Aarhus` ‚Üí analyzed as verb (Aarh + .us)
- `Abhazia` ‚Üí analyzed as adjective (Abhazi + .a)
- `Achrymowce` ‚Üí analyzed as adverb (Achrymowc + .e)

**Root cause:** These ARE Ido words (Abhazia = Abkhazia in Ido), but they're proper nouns, not common vocabulary.

**Impact:** ~500-1,000 entries might be geographic names

**Solutions:**
1. **Before full merge:** Create geographic name detector
2. **After merge:** Tag as proper nouns (np) instead of regular POS
3. **Manual review:** Remove obvious place names from vocabulary list

### Issue 2: Compound Words with Spaces

Some entries have spaces:
- `Alta teknologio` (High technology)

**Impact:** ~50-100 entries

**Solution:** These are multi-word terms - should they be:
- Removed (not single words)?
- Kept (they're valid Ido phrases)?
- Tagged differently?

### Issue 3: Some Identical Pairs Remain

Words like `Abdulino`‚Üí`Abdulino` (city name):
- Passed filters because has -o ending
- But it's a proper noun, not vocabulary

**Impact:** ~200-300 entries

**Solution:** Additional filter for capitalized words that are identical

## üí° Recommended Next Actions

### Option A: Proceed with Caution (Recommended)
1. ‚úÖ Test sample is validated and working
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Review test_merge_added.json manually
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Remove obvious place names (Aarhus, Abhazia, etc.)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Remove multi-word entries  
5. ‚úÖ Proceed with cleaned full merge

**Time:** +1 hour for manual review
**Result:** ~3,500-4,000 high-quality additions

### Option B: Add One More Filter (Before Full Merge)
Create filter to detect geographic names:
- Check if word is a known city/country
- Check if appears in geographic categories
- Remove from vocabulary, keep in geographic list

**Time:** +30 min to implement
**Result:** ~3,000-3,500 pure vocabulary additions

### Option C: Proceed As-Is (Fastest)
- Accept that some proper nouns will be in vocabulary
- Tag them correctly in dictionary (np vs n)
- Clean up later based on usage

**Time:** Immediate
**Result:** 5,031 additions (mixed quality)

## üìã My Recommendation

**Do Option A + B Combined:**

1. Create one more filter: "Detect Geographic Names"
2. Split entries into:
   - Pure vocabulary (~3,500)
   - Geographic names (~1,000)
   - Ambiguous (~500)
3. Test sample with pure vocabulary only (200 words)
4. If good, merge pure vocabulary
5. Handle geographic names separately

**Total time:** +45 minutes  
**Quality:** Highest  
**Result:** Clean vocabulary + properly tagged geographic names

## ‚ùì What Would You Like to Do?

1. **Proceed with Option A** (manual review of test sample)
2. **Add geographic name filter** (Option B)
3. **Combination approach** (recommended)
4. **Something else?**
